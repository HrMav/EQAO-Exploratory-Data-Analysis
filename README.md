EQAO School Test Data Analysis in Python

The Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO) is an arm's-length agency that provides information about student achievement in Ontario schools and school boards. This analysis delves deep into the EQAO dataset, which encompasses achievements across various grades in key areas like reading, writing, and mathematics.

The primary objective of our exploration is to understand the performance patterns of students across different grades.

This encapsulates the findings from our data analysis, providing educators, policymakers, and stakeholders a comprehensive understanding of student achievements in the Ontario school system.
